Hi Product Hunt ðŸ‘‹,

We were wondering how to get the ideas people had in mind? the closest answer I got was to look for them in the social media.
That's how we came with this idea, Infinideas gathers crowdsourced ideas from the web (currently from Reddit and Twitter) into a infinite newsfeed.

I personnally browse Infinideas everyday to check if there are not any interesting product to build next!
