Hi Product Hunt 👋,

We like to explore and build new products, but sometimes we don't know what are other people's problems. We were wondering how to get the ideas from people's minds and the closest answer we got was to look for them in social media and the web.
That's how we came with this idea, 💡 Infinideas gathers crowdsourced ideas from the web (currently from Reddit and Twitter) into an infinite newsfeed.

We personally browse Infinideas everyday to check if there are any interesting products to build next, and we are loving it ❤️!

The app is only on Android, because the AppStore refused to publish it 😢, so if you want to try on your iPhone, compile our source code from GitHub.
We decided to make Infinideas as a mobile app in Flutter because we like to learn something new with any new product we make 🤓

Sandoche, Etienne & Patricia
