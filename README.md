*🍎 The AppStore refused our app, so if you want to try on your iphone, clone this and compile it, that's why we kept it open source !*

## ☝️ Why this app ?

We were wondering how to get the ideas people had in mind? the closest answer I got was to look for them in the social media.
Also we heard a lot about flutter and we wanted to give a try, here what m feedback: https://medium.com/learning-lab/flutter-vs-nativescript-a-web-developers-perspective-1e9d4b9d8ad9

## 🚨 Disclaimer
We did this app very fast to test Flutter for our first time.
The code quality is pretty bad, we are aware of that, we are not proud at all because it does not meet our code quality standard 🙈😬
